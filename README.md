# Fire Game

## Purpose
This was my final project for Game Design I. For our final project, we had to make a fire themed 
game in Unity that showcased the skills we learned in class. I chose to make a 2D game where 
the player is being followed by fire and has to jump onto platforms to avoid it. To make the
game harder, I chose to have three obstacles that the player cannot touch. The blades and rocks
were made by my group members and the spikes were made by me.

## Starting the Game
The game was exported and included in a folder in this repo. Find the fire.exe file and click it 
to play. The Unity file is attached as well.

## How to Play
Use the arrow keys to move, the up arrow key will make the player jump. When you start the game, 
you have a few seconds to move before the fire starts to move upward and follow you. Jump onto 
the platforms and avoid touching the blades, rocks, and spikes while you run from the fire. You
are given three lives.
